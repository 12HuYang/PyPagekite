.SH NAME


pagekite v0.5.8d \- Make localhost servers publicly visible

.SH SYNOPSIS


\fBpagekite\fR [\fI\-\-options\fR] [\fIservice\fR] \fIkite\-name\fR [\fI+flags\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION


PageKite is a system for exposing \fIlocalhost\fR servers to the
public Internet.  It is most commonly used to make local web servers or
SSH servers publicly visible, although almost any TCP\-based protocol can
work if the client knows how to use an HTTP proxy.

PageKite uses a combination of tunnels and reverse proxies to compensate
for the fact that \fIlocalhost\fR usually does not have a public IP
address and is often subject to adverse network conditions, including
aggressive firewalls and multiple layers of NAT.

This program implements both ends of the tunnel: the local "back\-end"
and the remote "front\-end" reverse\-proxy relay.  For convenience,
\fBpagekite\fR also includes a basic HTTP server for quickly exposing
files and directories to the World Wide Web for casual sharing and
collaboration.

.SH BASIC USAGE



.nf
Basic usage, gives \fIhttp://localhost:80/\fR a public name:
$ pagekite NAME.pagekite.me

To expose specific folders, files or use alternate local ports:
$ pagekite /a/path/ NAME.pagekite.me +indexes  # built\-in HTTPD
$ pagekite *.html   NAME.pagekite.me           # built\-in HTTPD
$ pagekite 3000     NAME.pagekite.me           # HTTPD on 3000

To expose multiple local servers (SSH and HTTP):
$ pagekite ssh://NAME.pagekite.me AND 3000 NAME.pagekite.me
.fi


.SH SERVICES AND KITES


The most comman usage of \fBpagekite\fR is as a back\-end, where it
is used to expose local services to the outside world.

Examples of services are: a local HTTP server, a local SSH server,
a folder or a file.

A service is exposed by describing it on the command line, along with the
desired public kite name. If a kite name is requested which does not already
exist in the configuration file and program is run interactively, the user
will be prompted and given the option of signing up and/or creating a new
kite using the \fBpagekite.net\fR service.

Multiple services and kites can be specified on a single command\-line,
separated by the word 'AND' (note capital letters are required).
This may cause problems if you have many files and folders by that
name, but that should be relatively rare. :\-)

.SH KITE CONFIGURATION


The options \fB\-\-list\fR, \fB\-\-add\fR, \fB\-\-disable\fR and \fB\-\-remove\fR can be used to
manipulate the kites and service definitions in your configuration file,
if you prefer not to edit it by hand.  Examples:


.nf
Adding new kites
$ pagekite \-\-add /a/path/ NAME.pagekite.me +indexes
$ pagekite \-\-add 80 OTHER\-NAME.pagekite.me

To display the current configuration
$ pagekite \-\-list

Disable or delete kites (\-\-add re\-enables)
$ pagekite \-\-disable OTHER\-NAME.pagekite.me
$ pagekite \-\-remove NAME.pagekite.me
.fi


.SH FLAGS


Flags are used to tune the behavior of a particular kite, for example
by enabling access controls or specific features of the built\-in HTTP
server.

.SH OPTIONS


The full power of \fBpagekite\fR lies in the numerous options which
can be specified on the command line or in a configuration file (see below).

Note that many options, especially the service and domain definitions,
are additive and if given multiple options the program will attempt to
obey them all.  Options are processed in order and if they are not
additive then the last option will override all preceding ones.

Although \fBpagekite\fR accepts a great many options, most of the
time the program defaults will Just Work.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILES


If you are using \fBpagekite\fR as a command\-line utility, it will
load its configuration from a file in your home directory.  The file is
named \fI.pagekite.rc\fR on Unix systems (including Mac OS X), or
\fIpagekite.cfg\fR on Windows.

If you are using \fBpagekite\fR as a system\-daemon which starts up
when your computer boots, it is generally configured to load settings
from \fI/etc/pagekite.d/*.rc\fR (in lexicographical order).

In both cases, the configuration files contain one or more of the same
options as are used on the command line, with the difference that at most
one option may be present on each line, and the parser is more tolerant of
white\-space.  The leading '\-\-' may also be omitted for readability and
blank lines and lines beginning with '#' are treated as comments.

\fBNOTE:\fR When using \fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-optfile\fR or \fB\-\-optdir\fR on the command line,
it is advisable to use \fB\-\-clean\fR to suppress the default configuration.

.SH SECURITY


Please keep in mind, that whenever exposing a server to the public
Internet, it is important to think about security. Hacked webservers are
frequently abused as part of virus, spam or phishing campaigns and in
some cases security breaches can compromise the entire operating system.

Some advice:
.nf

* Switch PageKite off when not using it.
* Use the built\-in access controls and SSL encryption.
* Leave the firewall enabled unless you have good reason not to.
* Make sure you use good passwords everywhere.
* Static content is very hard to hack!
* Always, always make frequent backups of any important work.
.fi


Note that as of version 0.5, \fBpagekite\fR includes a very basic
request firewall, which attempts to prevent access to phpMyAdmin and
other sensitive systems.  If it gets in your way, the \fB+insecure\fR
flag or \fB\-\-insecure\fR option can be used to turn it off.

For more, please visit: <https://pagekite.net/support/security/>

.SH BUGS


Using \fBpagekite\fR as a front\-end relay with the native Python SSL
module may result in poor performance.  Please use the pyOpenSSL wrappers
instead.
