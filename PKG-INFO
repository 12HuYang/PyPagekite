Description: PageKite is a system for running publicly visible servers (generally
        web servers) on machines without a direct connection to the Internet,
        such as mobile devices or computers behind restrictive firewalls.
        PageKite works around NAT, firewalls and IP-address limitations by
        using a combination of  tunnels and reverse proxies.
        
        Natively supported protocols: HTTP, HTTPS
        Partially supported protocols: IRC, Finger
        
        Any other TCP-based service, including SSH and VNC, may be exposed
        as well to clients supporting HTTP Proxies.
