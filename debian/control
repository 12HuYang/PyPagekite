Description: Run public servers without reconfiguring firewalls.
 PageKite removes the need to reconfigure firewalls or routers in
 order to run a public server from home or your mobile devices.
 .
 Pagekite.py is the Python implementation of the PageKite remote web
 front-end protocol, implementing a tunneled reverse proxy which allows
 you to run public HTTP or HTTPS servers on machines without direct
 connectivity to the Internet. Other protocols (SSH etc.) are partially
 supported as well.
 .
 This package implements both ends of the tunnel and is compatible
 with the (optional) front-end service provided by http://pagekite.net/.
